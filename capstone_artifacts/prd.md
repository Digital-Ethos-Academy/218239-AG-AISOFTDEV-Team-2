# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Vacation Rental Recommendation MVP

## 1. Problem Statement

Travelers seeking vacation rentals often struggle to find properties that are conveniently located near their desired activities or attractions. Existing platforms require users to manually search for rentals and cross-reference locations with activity sites, leading to a time-consuming and inefficient experience.

## 2. Objectives

- Provide users with personalized vacation rental recommendations based on their preferred activities and attractions.
- Enable users to easily reserve a recommended vacation rental property.
- Streamline the vacation planning process by connecting activity preferences directly to rental options.

## 3. User Stories

1. **As a user, I want to specify a list of activities or attractions I wish to visit, so that I can receive relevant vacation rental recommendations.**

2. **As a user, I want to receive a list of vacation rental properties recommended based on proximity to my selected activities or attractions, so that I can choose the most convenient option.**

3. **As a user, I want to view details of a recommended property, so that I can make an informed reservation decision.**

4. **As a user, I want to make a reservation at my selected property, so that I can secure my accommodation for my trip.**
