# FastAPI Security Review

The provided FastAPI code implements user, property, and reservation management with some LLM-based recommendation features. Below is a comprehensive security review structured by category:

---

## 1. **Input Validation Issues**

### Findings

- **Lack of Explicit Input Validation**:  
  The application depends on the Pydantic models in `schemas` (not shown) for input validation. If these schemas do not explicitly validate required fields, types, value ranges, email formats, or constraints (e.g., no negative prices, valid dates), bad or malicious data could be accepted.

- **Email Validation**:  
  - `email` fields are assigned directly from `user.email` without explicit validation. If `schemas.UserCreate` doesn't enforce a proper email format (e.g., `EmailStr`), invalid emails may be accepted.
  - No normalization of email addresses (case, whitespace, etc.).

- **Interests and Amenities**:  
  - Interests and amenities are stored as comma-separated strings, but there’s no explicit sanitation, max length, or allowed value checks. This could result in malformed or excessively large database entries.

- **Date Validation**:  
  - The reservation endpoints check that `check_in_date < check_out_date`, but do **not** check that the dates are not in the past, or that the period is reasonable (e.g., not years long).

- **Property Fields**:  
  - No checks for empty or invalid data in fields like address, city, state, price, etc.
  - `price_per_night` is not validated for being positive.

- **User/Property Existence**:  
  - Most endpoints check if a user or property exists before acting, which is good.

### Risks

- **Unexpected behavior, database errors, or security issues (e.g., DoS) from malformed or very large inputs.**
- **Invalid emails may break workflows or be abused for spam.**
- **Improperly formatted interests/amenities may break recommendation logic.**
- **Negative or nonsensical prices.**
- **Dates in the past or unreasonable reservation periods.**

### Recommendations

- Use `pydantic.EmailStr` for email fields in schemas.
- Add stricter validation (min/max lengths, regex, value ranges) in all schemas.
- Sanitize/normalize string fields (strip whitespace, lowercase emails, etc.).
- Validate that all required fields are present and correct.
- Add max length constraints and allowed value lists for interests/amenities.
- Ensure `price_per_night` is positive and reasonable.
- Validate reservation dates (not in the past, reasonable duration).
- Consider using array types for interests/amenities if supported by your database.

## 2. **SQL Injection Risks**

### Findings

- **ORM Usage**:  
  All database access appears to use SQLAlchemy ORM querying methods (e.g., `.filter(models.User.id == user_id)`), which are parameterized and not susceptible to classic SQL injection.

- **No Raw SQL**:  
  There are no raw SQL queries observed in the provided code.

### Risks

- **Minimal with current code, unless the underlying models use raw SQL somewhere else.**
- **If `list_to_comma_string` or similar functions are used in unsafe ways in other code, risk may increase.**

### Recommendations

- Continue using SQLAlchemy ORM methods.
- **Ensure no raw SQL is used in `models` or elsewhere without proper parameterization.**
- Be cautious with any dynamic query construction.

## 3. **Authentication and Authorization Gaps**

### Findings

- **No Authentication Implemented**:  
  No endpoint requires any authentication; all are freely accessible.

- **No Authorization Checks**:  
  - Any user can create, update, or delete any user, property, or reservation.
  - Any user can view other users’ data, all reservations, all properties.

- **Sensitive Operations Unrestricted**:  
  - User updates/deletes are not protected; anyone can delete any user or modify any account.
  - Reservation endpoints allow anyone to view, modify, or delete any reservation.

### Risks

- **Data Theft or Manipulation**:  
  Anyone can read/modify/delete any data, including other users’ data and reservations.
- **Account Hijacking/Abuse**:  
  Users can impersonate others or delete accounts.
- **Potential GDPR or privacy law violations.**

### Recommendations

- **Implement Authentication**:  
  Use OAuth2, JWT, session cookies, or another method to authenticate users.
- **Enforce Authorization**:  
  - Require users to be authenticated for all non-public endpoints.
  - Restrict update/delete operations to the resource owner (e.g., only users can edit or delete their accounts).
  - Limit reservation modifications to the user who made the reservation (or admins).
  - Restrict property creation/modification/deletion to authorized admins or owners.

## 4. **Data Exposure and Leakage**

### Findings

- **Sensitive Data in Responses**:  
  - User endpoints return `id`, `name`, `email`, `interests`. If additional sensitive fields (e.g., password hashes) are present in the model, there’s a risk of accidental exposure (though not shown in this code).
  - All user and reservation data is visible to any client.

- **Verbose Logging/Printing**:  
  - Multiple `print()` statements output user interests, property lists, LLM responses, etc. If logs are not secured, sensitive data could leak.

- **Error Handling**:  
  - Errors use HTTPException with generic messages, which is good. No stack traces or internal errors are exposed.

### Risks

- **Exposure of user emails and possibly other PII to unauthorized clients.**
- **Leakage of sensitive details via logs, especially in production.**

### Recommendations

- **Limit returned user data to non-sensitive fields.**
- **Never return password hashes or sensitive fields.**
- **Remove or limit `print()` statements, especially in production.**
- **Secure logs and avoid logging sensitive user data.**
- **Consider returning only the current user’s own data, unless explicitly allowed.**

## 5. **Other Common Vulnerabilities**

### Findings

- **CORS Configuration**:  
  - `allow_origins=["*"]` combined with `allow_credentials=True` is dangerous and violates the CORS spec. Browsers will ignore credentials with a wildcard origin, but this is still a bad practice.
  - All methods and headers are allowed.

- **No CSRF Protection**:  
  - APIs are stateless, but if cookies/sessions are ever used, CSRF must be considered.

- **XSS**:  
  - No HTML is rendered by the API, but if property names, interests, or amenities are rendered unescaped in a frontend, XSS is possible.

- **No Rate Limiting**:  
  - The API is open to brute-force or DoS attacks.

- **File Uploads/Path Traversal**:  
  - No file uploads present, so no direct risk.
  - No evidence of path traversal risks.

- **Insecure Headers**:  
  - No security headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, etc.) set, which is common in API backends but still worth mentioning.

- **LLM Prompt Injection**:  
  - The LLM recommendation feature takes user interests and property info and feeds them directly to the LLM. If a user crafts malicious interests, they might be able to influence or inject prompts (prompt injection). This could cause the LLM to return unexpected results, data leakage, or even code (if ever executed).

### Risks

- **CORS misconfiguration could allow cross-origin credential leaks if credentials are used.**
- **LLM prompt injection could result in unintended LLM output.**
- **Potential XSS if frontend is not careful.**
- **No rate limiting allows abuse.**
- **Lack of secure headers may expose clients to attacks.**

### Recommendations

- **Set `allow_origins` to a specific list (e.g., your frontend domain). Never use `"*"` with `allow_credentials=True`.**
- **If you use cookies/sessions, implement CSRF protection.**
- **Sanitize all user inputs before sending to LLM; consider prompt injection mitigation.**
- **Implement rate limiting.**
- **Set appropriate security headers.**
- **Ensure frontend escapes all user-supplied content before rendering.**

## 6. **LLM-Specific Risks**

### Findings

- **Prompt Injection**:  
  - User-controlled input (`interests`) is injected directly into the LLM prompt, with no sanitization or filtering.
  - If the LLM can return arbitrary output, a malicious user could craft input to cause the LLM to leak information or not follow instructions.

- **Overly Trusting LLM Output**:  
  - The code loads and parses the LLM’s JSON output and uses it to select property IDs from the DB, with no further validation.
  - If the LLM is tricked into outputting property IDs that don’t exist, or even negative or non-integer values, it may cause unexpected behavior.

### Recommendations

- **Sanitize and filter user input before including in prompts.**
- **Validate LLM output: ensure only valid, existing property IDs are accepted; ignore or log invalid IDs.**
- **Consider prompt injection defenses (e.g., delimiters, strict prompt templates).**

# **Actionable Steps**

1. **Implement authentication and per-resource authorization.**
2. **Harden input validation in all schemas and endpoints.**
3. **Remove `"*"` from `allow_origins`, set to known trusted origins.**
4. **Remove or secure all print/logging of potentially sensitive data.**
5. **Sanitize all user-provided input before including in LLM prompts; validate LLM output.**
6. **Return only non-sensitive, minimal user data in API responses.**
7. **Add rate limiting to prevent abuse.**
8. **Set security headers and plan for CSRF if sessions/cookies are ever used.**
